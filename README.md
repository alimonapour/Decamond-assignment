# Decamond Assignment Flow Project

A simple yet robust authentication system built with Next.js (App Router),
TypeScript, and SCSS Modules. This project demonstrates a complete
authentication flow, from a login page with validation to a protected dashboard
page, with a focus on code quality, reusability, and modern front-end practices.
The user interface is in Persian and styled for a right-to-left (RTL) layout.
